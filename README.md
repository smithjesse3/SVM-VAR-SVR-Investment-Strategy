Implemented a trading strategy using SVR for predicting stock prices and trading every 7days as buy, hold, or sell, on a selected bucket of stocks comparing the performance against the typical "buy-and-hold" strategy. As seen in the notebook trading strategy outperformed buy and hold in this timeframe.
